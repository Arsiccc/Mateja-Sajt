        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          I'm a student currently based in Kosovska Mitrovica, Serbia. I have a
          passion for web design and programming.

          <h3>Programming and Web Design</h3>
          <p>
            I gained an interest in coding from a young age, wanting to create
            fun video games. Over time, I have gained some experience and now
            have elemental knowledge in both of these fields. I have a basic
            understanding of HTML, CSS, Python, as well as C language.

          <h3>Guitar</h3>
          <p>
            I like to play guitar in my free time, having completed 6 years of
            music school, I am currently attending a Rock School in my hometown.
            To be honest, I still don't know how to play any fun music yet, only
            the classical pieces I have encountered during my schooling.

          <h3>Martial Arts</h3>
          <p>
            I am a trained professional in martial arts, specifically karate. I
            have been practicing it for around 10 years, and currently have a
            brown belt. I am aspiring to get a black belt, which I will try to
            acomplish in around one year time from now. I was hit by Covid 2
            times in a short period so my cardio is pretty lacking.
